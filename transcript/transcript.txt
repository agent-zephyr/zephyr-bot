[00:00:00 --> 00:00:07]  I'm Alan Stanley for Howdini.com, and in this segment, we'll be talking about changing a
[00:00:07 --> 00:00:08]  flat tire.
[00:00:08 --> 00:00:12]  Certainly, it's inconvenient, but we're going to walk you through it step-by-step.
[00:00:12 --> 00:00:17]  Lift up this cover to access the spare tire.
[00:00:17 --> 00:00:22]  We'll unloosen it with the hole down, then give it a couple good raps.
[00:00:22 --> 00:00:23]  Make sure it's full of air.
[00:00:23 --> 00:00:27]  Worst thing you'd want to do is put on a flat spare, then you'll remove the tire.
[00:00:27 --> 00:00:29]  Careful, this can be quite heavy.
[00:00:29 --> 00:00:32]  Well, we have our spare tire in our jack.
[00:00:32 --> 00:00:34]  We've set our reflective warning signal out.
[00:00:34 --> 00:00:39]  We've also chucked the wheel on the opposite side of the flat tire, so we're ready to start
[00:00:39 --> 00:00:40]  changing it.
[00:00:40 --> 00:00:43]  The first thing we'll do is jack the vehicle up.
[00:00:43 --> 00:00:46]  You'll have to loosen the jack a little bit in order to get the handle off.
[00:00:46 --> 00:00:53]  This particular model has a lug wrench built right in.
[00:00:53 --> 00:00:56]  Before we jack, though, we'd want to loosen the lug nuts, because once it's jacked up,
[00:00:56 --> 00:00:59]  it's going to be very difficult to get those lug nuts off.
[00:00:59 --> 00:01:04]  This particular model has a hubcap, which we'll just loosen those up.
[00:01:04 --> 00:01:10]  Doesn't take much, because they're made out of plastic.
[00:01:10 --> 00:01:16]  Set the hubcap out of the way, now you have access to the lug nuts.
[00:01:16 --> 00:01:23]  Loosen the lug nuts, position yourself firmly, pressing counterclockwise, loosen the lug
[00:01:23 --> 00:01:24]  nuts.
[00:01:24 --> 00:01:26]  Not too loose, just enough to crack them.
[00:01:26 --> 00:01:34]  If it's a little stubborn, position yourself over, using your knee or your foot, you can
[00:01:34 --> 00:01:35]  gain leverage.
[00:01:35 --> 00:01:36]  Now we're ready to jack it up.
[00:01:36 --> 00:01:39]  This is a common scissors jack.
[00:01:39 --> 00:01:44]  The screw moves in and out, allowing the mechanism to move up and down and lift your car.
[00:01:44 --> 00:01:47]  So as you turn it to the right, it'll go up.
[00:01:47 --> 00:01:52]  As you loosen it, the jack will collapse, allowing the car to come down.
[00:01:52 --> 00:01:56]  Now we'll position the jack.
[00:01:56 --> 00:01:59]  You want to be sure to get the jack on a good part of the frame.
[00:01:59 --> 00:02:05]  Your owner's manual is a good place to find where to properly jack the vehicle.
[00:02:05 --> 00:02:13]  You can raise it up by hand, until it contacts the frame and is in good position.
[00:02:13 --> 00:02:15]  We use the jack handle to raise the vehicle.
[00:02:15 --> 00:02:19]  Insert the end of the jack handle into the jack.
[00:02:19 --> 00:02:21]  Using it as leverage, it'll help make the car go up easier.
[00:02:22 --> 00:02:28]  Remember to turn it clockwise to go up, and counterclockwise to go down.
[00:02:28 --> 00:02:29]  Carefully jack the car up.
[00:02:29 --> 00:02:33]  Never stick your hands or your legs under the vehicle, as the car can fall and cause
[00:02:33 --> 00:02:37]  damage.
[00:02:37 --> 00:02:44]  Jacking can take a while, so be patient and cautious as you jack.
[00:02:44 --> 00:02:47]  Okay now that the car is jacked up, now we'll take the lug nuts loose.
[00:02:47 --> 00:02:50]  Remember, we already pre-loosened them when the car was on the ground, making it easy.
[00:02:51 --> 00:02:53]  You'll notice they'll come right off now.
[00:02:53 --> 00:03:00]  Trying to do that while the car was jacked up would be very difficult.
[00:03:00 --> 00:03:02]  Remember to keep your lug nuts in close hand.
[00:03:02 --> 00:03:05]  You don't want them rolling away in the grass, because they'll be hard to find, and that's
[00:03:05 --> 00:03:07]  what holds your tire on.
[00:03:07 --> 00:03:16]  Again, we're turning them counterclockwise to get them loose, or to the left.
[00:03:16 --> 00:03:21]  We'll remove the flat tire, set it over here out of the way.
[00:03:21 --> 00:03:24]  Now if there was heavy traffic area, you wouldn't want to leave it in the street.
[00:03:24 --> 00:03:26]  You might want to put it to the rear of the car.
[00:03:26 --> 00:03:30]  Grab the spare tire, put it in position.
[00:03:30 --> 00:03:33]  You're going to center the spare tire on the wheel studs.
[00:03:33 --> 00:03:34]  That's where the lug nuts go.
[00:03:34 --> 00:03:40]  So go ahead and do that, lining it up.
[00:03:40 --> 00:03:43]  You see it lines up pretty easy.
[00:03:43 --> 00:03:46]  Then install your lug nuts.
[00:03:46 --> 00:03:51]  Again, clockwise is tight, counterclockwise is loose.
[00:03:51 --> 00:04:00]  So we'll tighten them up by hand as far as they'll go.
[00:04:00 --> 00:04:05]  Once the tire is centered, lug nuts are hand tight, take the lug wrench.
[00:04:05 --> 00:04:11]  Again, turning it clockwise, tighten the lugs until they're firm.
[00:04:11 --> 00:04:14]  Not too tight, because remember, your car is up on a jack.
[00:04:14 --> 00:04:26]  We wouldn't want it falling off with too much leverage or force.
[00:04:26 --> 00:04:30]  Insert the jack handle back into the jack, turning it counterclockwise again, we're going
[00:04:30 --> 00:04:32]  to lower the vehicle.
[00:04:32 --> 00:04:36]  Again, this will take some time, but going down is a lot easier than going up.
[00:04:36 --> 00:04:40]  If it seems to be going down easy, you can just do it like this by doing it straight
[00:04:40 --> 00:04:42]  instead of having it angled.
[00:04:42 --> 00:04:45]  But if it's too tough, you can angle it and get the leverage that you'll need to lower
[00:04:45 --> 00:04:50]  the jack or to raise the jack.
[00:04:50 --> 00:04:53]  Turn the jack low enough, you can do it by hand now that it doesn't have contact with
[00:04:53 --> 00:04:55]  the frame, and we can remove it.
[00:04:55 --> 00:04:59]  Now that the tire is on the ground, we'll go ahead and give them that final tight.
[00:04:59 --> 00:05:04]  We're going to start down here, then move to the top one, then back down, over, and
[00:05:04 --> 00:05:05]  back again.
[00:05:05 --> 00:05:10]  A little star pattern, making sure we have equal torque on the wheel studs.
[00:05:10 --> 00:05:17]  Okay, well we have our spare tire on, it's aired up, we're ready to go.
[00:05:17 --> 00:05:19]  A couple things to remember though is you want to put everything back in the trunk,
[00:05:19 --> 00:05:22]  you don't want to exceed highway speed on this temporary spare.
[00:05:22 --> 00:05:25]  Make sure you get the big tire fixed, and we'll get you back on the road as soon as
[00:05:25 --> 00:05:26]  possible.
